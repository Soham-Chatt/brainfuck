<h3>What is brainfuck?</h3>
<p>Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language known for its minimalism and extreme difficulty to program in.
    It uses only eight commands, each represented by a single character, to manipulate a memory tape with cells
    that can store and retrieve values. While it is not practical for most programming tasks, Brainfuck can be used
    for educational purposes or as a challenge for experienced programmers.</p>
    <p>To use Brainfuck, you first need to understand its eight commands:</p>
    <code>&gt;</code>: move the data pointer to the right<br>
    <code>&lt;</code>: move the data pointer to the left <br>
    <code>+</code>: increment the value at the data pointer <br>
    <code>-</code>: decrement the value at the data pointer <br>
    <code>.</code>: output the value at the data pointer as a character <br>
    <code>,</code>: input a character and store it at the data pointer <br>
    <code>[</code>: if the value at the data pointer is zero, jump to the matching <code>]</code> <br>
    <code>]</code>: if the value at the data pointer is nonzero, jump to the matching <code>[</code> <br>
    <p>To write a Brainfuck program, you simply combine these commands to manipulate the memory tape and perform
        computations. While it can be challenging to write complex programs in Brainfuck, simple programs can be
        written relatively easily with some practice.</p>
